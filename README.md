# Who am I?
Hey, I am Jan, I am a fullstack developer, my favourite languages are JavaScript, Python(, HTML and CSS). I like to use these frameworks/modules for my projects, at every project you can see all the used frameworks: ReactJS, NodeJS, TailwindCss and sometimes Angular.
### Something personal about me
I live in germany (Baden-WÃ¼rrtemberg) and I am a student.
### Future plans
I want to learn Kotlin and C#. My dream is to work at FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix or Google).

## Do you have a project idea for me?
You can send me a direct message on twitter ([@jlno05](https://twitter.com/jlno05)).
